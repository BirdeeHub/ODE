learning how to write a programming language

No, I have not read anything on the topic. I'm just going to try it.

learning rust

currently its just a tokenizer but this is all of the rust code I have ever written in my life so thats a good start!

Do not expect progress in this repository, learning is the goal, not a good language.

This is effectively just me drawing in the margins of my notebook.
